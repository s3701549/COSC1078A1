<p>If I’m the team manager, I will assigning different tasks to people who have different personality. If people who are outgoing, these people usually have communication and language skills, so they are Suitable to be a diplomat; If people who are introverted, these kind of people always have sense of responsibility and work very hard in the team. So they are suitable to be a staff such as programmer.
That my opinion.</p>

<h2>5.Project ideas</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I want to developing a smartphone app about the school which is help a school to realize intelligent management online. For example: teacher can check each students’ status, such as Attendance, homework completion and so on. Student enroll, Class allocation, teacher assigned also be included by this app. In addition, student can email their teacher, students’ parent also can contact their children’s teacher in this app. The teacher can share courseware and homework on the app. 
So this school app can promote the efficiency of school management, reduce the input of related resources, and improve the work efficiency. That what I want.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Education is very important for a country, but traditional school the way to operation is inconvenient. Take a simple example, each student need to go to school for enroll and they must take their tuition to the school and give it to their teacher. Many students will miss their enroll time because of some reasons or they will lose their tuition. Why we not use some easy way to instead of that such as do this online? I know some universities have had this kind of app, like RMIT university. But a lot of primary school and high school 
not have this kind of app yet, so school app still have huge potential nowadays.</p>
<h3>Description </h3>
<p>There are four main parts of this app:</p>
<h4>Intelligent management</h4>
<p>It’s not easy for school administration before a new semester start of the school, so this app will help to student enroll, student can check their information, the app will according to their information assign them to the correct grade, the class will be automatic allocated(of course student can choose class which they want, but if this class full they can not choose). teachers also can log in this app to check which class they are assigned. After that the fee they should pay will be displayed and they can pay online or take it to their class adviser, if student pay online, related receipt will be send to their home.</p>
<h4>Communication</h4>
<p>All the time, student and their parents have less communicate with students’ teacher. One of the reason is their parents are busy, have no time to communicate with the teacher and some students are afraid to communicate with teachers. So this app support to online communication with teachers and students/parents. They can open a chat window any time, you can send message/images even Emoji! If student do not like that, don’t worry, each teachers’ information will be recorded in the database of this app, student can easy to find the teachers’ phone number, email address and so on.  </p>
<h4>Encourage students to study and review</h4>
<p>Now many students have their own smartphone, but some of them enjoy playing games and forget study or do their homework. In order to avoid students addicted to mobile phone games, The school distributes learning plans and arrangements to each student's mobile apps. The app also will provide some learning-related games lead students to be interested in learning, make student study and review consciously.</p>
<h4>Resource sharing</h4>
<p>Whatever students and teachers, they can share a good learning method though this app. App provide a forum to student and teacher sharing their learning method and experience, teacher also can upload courseware and Review information. It’s make students get common progress.

  <h3>Skill required</h3>
  • The most basic is a knowledge of the Java language and XML language foundation: objective-c language, x code development environment and enough mobile phone use experience.<br>
        ◦ Skills required: JAVA basic grammar, design patterns, Linux basic knowledge, database basic knowledge, network protocol, Basic knowledge of android, server-side development, PHP and so on.<br>
        ◦ About the feasible to find the skills, software and hardware required: Firstly, before we start this project, we should have a company, and a work team is necessary, it’s including project manager, technical personnel, test personnel and so on. So these people should meet technical requirements what the above-mentioned, otherwise we can't make a perfect software. Then is hardware, we need to have enough capital before the company is founded and purchase the infrastructure such as computers and servers, after that, we will install the necessary software in each computer such as Android Studio, database(SQL) etc… Ensure the daily operation of the company.<br>
